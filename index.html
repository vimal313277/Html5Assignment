           • How to embed audio and video in a webpage?

          
          Answer :-
          
                Create a new HTML file in the same directory, called index. html . Add <audio> and <video> elements to the 
             page; make them display the default browser controls. Give both of them <source> elements so that browsers
             will find the audio format they support best and load it.


                The easiest way to add video or sound to your web site is to include the special HTML tag called <embed>.
             This tag causes the browser itself to include controls for the multimedia automatically provided
             browser supports <embed> tag and given media type.
            

            * HTML <audio> Tag
                <audio controls>
                <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
                <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                </audio>
   
              
            * The HTML <video> Element
                <video  controls >
                <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"> -->

        • Semantic element in HTML5?

         Answer:-
          
            The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The main content area
         consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central
         functionality of an application.

            Semantics is about using the correct element in HTML. There are approximately 110 elements in HTML 5. Two of
         them have no meaning – <div> and <span> . They tell us nothing about the content.

          
        * Examples of semantic elements :-

                   <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content. -->

           • Canvas and SVG tags

         Answer :-
             
              * Canvas:-
              
                -> Raster based (Composed of pixel)

                -> Canvas has poor scalability. Hence it is not suitable for printing on higher resolution.

                -> The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The
                   <canvas> tag is transparent, and is only a container for graphics ...

                -> The <canvas> tag in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page using JavaScript. It can be used to
                   text. Note: The <canvas> tag is new in HTML5.

                

        
              * SVG :-

               -> Vector based (composed of shapes)	

               -> SVG has better scalability. So it can be printed with high quality at any resolution.	

               -> SVG images can be written directly into the HTML document using the <svg> </svg> tag. To do this, open 
                  the SVG image in VS code or your preferred IDE, copy the code, and paste it inside the <body> element in
                  your HTML document. If you did everything correctly, your webpage should look exactly like the demo
                   -->
